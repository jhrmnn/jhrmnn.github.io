statement: |
  My work focuses on advancing quantum chemistry through tight integration of deep learning.
  I search for suitable entry points for machine learning in electronic structure theory and incorporate exact priors induced by the underlying physics into neural-network and training architectures.
  The goal is to push through the simulation scale–accuracy trade-off offered by traditional methods of quantum chemistry.

statement: |
  My research focuses on advancing quantum chemistry through tight integration of deep learning.
  I search for suitable entry points for machine learning in electronic structure theory and incorporate exact priors induced by the underlying physics into neural-network and training architectures.
  The goal is to push through the existing scale–accuracy tradeoff offered by traditional methods of quantum chemistry.

It’s not good vs evil. They are not opposites on a spectrum. They are two independent instincts developed through evolution. Evil as egoism, competitiveness, war. Good as altruism, kindness, solidarity. Both are activated by tribalism, good towards us, evil against them. Each person has a propensity to both, cultivated by their upbringing and culture, and influenced by their present environment. Morality is an attempt to build a theory of the two instincts, but the instincts are the empirical ground truth. One can have both instincts active at the same time, good towards one individual or a group, evil against another. Morality cannot be universal—the instincts dictate that the moral value of a behavior depends on the tribal status of its recipient.

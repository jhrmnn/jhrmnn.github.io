bio: |
  Computational chemist and physicist by [training️](#Education),
  who got later hooked on machine learning,
  and now enjoys [integrating](https://chemistrycommunity.nature.com/posts/deep-neural-electronic-wave-functions) deep learning into quantum chemistry.
  I was born and raised in [Český Krumlov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Český_Krumlov),
  moved for university to [Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague),
  and later for a Phd to [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin),
  where I now live with [my wife](https://scd.sk/autor/simona-beresova/) and our little kid.
  Currently I'm a quantum chemistry [lead](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/janhermann/) at [Microsoft Research AI4Science](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-ai4science/) in Berlin.
statement: |
  My work focuses on advancing quantum chemistry through tight integration of deep learning.
  I search for suitable entry points for machine learning in electronic structure theory and incorporate exact priors induced by the underlying physics into neural-network and training architectures.
  The goal is to push through the simulation scale–accuracy trade-off offered by traditional methods of quantum chemistry.
